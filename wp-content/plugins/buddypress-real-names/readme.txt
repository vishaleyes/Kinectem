BuddyPress Real Names allows you to change the regular nickname displayed for a user to anything you want.


== Description ==

BuddyPress Real Names allows you to change the regular nickname displayed for a user to anything you want, 
for example for displaying something like "John Smith", "Smith John Mr", "jsmith44 (John Smith)", or any other combination of xprofile fields.

You can set rules to display names differently on their profile pages or in the members lists (eg. "John Smith" on the profile and "Smith John, Mr" in the lists).
When ordering members lists alphabetically, you can choose the priority of the fields that will be sorted !

== Installation ==

2.  Copy the content from the plugin's */theme* directory to your current theme directory.
3.  In the Administration Panel > Settings > General, change the default role from *Subscriber* to *Wiki Author*; or give the required capabilities to your users.
